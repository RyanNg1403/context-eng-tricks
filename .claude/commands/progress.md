# Progress Report Command

## Purpose

The `.progress` command generates a comprehensive summary of the current session, documenting all work completed, decisions made, and next steps. This report serves as a handoff document for future sessions and maintains continuity across development cycles.

## Workflow

### 1. **Session Analysis**
  - Review all messages, commands executed, and files modified during the current session
  - Identify key milestones, decisions, and completed tasks
  - Catalog any errors encountered and their resolutions
  - Note any architectural patterns or coding standards applied

### 2. **Context Retrieval**
  - Gather relevant context from:
    - Previous progress reports and session summaries
    - Related project milestones and development phases
    - Ongoing feature development or bug fixes
    - Team decisions and architectural choices made in prior sessions

### 3. **Progress Documentation**
  - Generate a structured report including:
    - **Session Overview**: Date, duration, primary objectives
    - **Completed Tasks**: Detailed list with file references and descriptions
    - **Code Changes**: Summary of modifications, additions, and deletions
    - **Decisions Made**: Architectural, design, or implementation choices
    - **Issues Resolved**: Bugs fixed, problems solved, blockers removed
    - **Testing Status**: Tests written, coverage added, validation performed
    - **Knowledge Gained**: New patterns learned, APIs discovered, techniques applied

### 4. **Future Planning**
  - Document:
    - **Next Steps**: Immediate tasks for the next session
    - **Pending Items**: Incomplete work or deferred decisions
    - **Blockers**: Dependencies or issues requiring attention
    - **Recommendations**: Suggested approaches or improvements
    - **Context Notes**: Important details for session continuity

### 5. **Knowledge Storage**
  - Save important findings:
    - Session summary and key accomplishments
    - Reusable patterns or solutions discovered
    - Important architectural decisions and rationale
    - Lessons learned and best practices identified

### 6. **Report Generation**
  - Create a `progress.md` file with:
    - Clear section headers and bullet points
    - File paths and line references where applicable
    - Code snippets for important changes
    - Links to relevant documentation or issues
    - Actionable next steps with priority levels
